Response to Exercise 1:
No, unless it is scheduled right back to sys_getpid(), that is, only one process is running. Otherwise, since the INT_SYS_GETPID passed the PID onto the %eax register and sys_getpid() reads the PID from %eax, if scheduled to another process, the value will be modified and thus sys_getpid() will not have the correct value returned.
